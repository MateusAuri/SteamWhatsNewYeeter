# Steam Library's "What's New" Yeeter

## What's this?
- This batch/powershell script hides that annoying "What's New" section from your Steam Library (on Windows)

## How do I use it?
- Exit Steam
- Navigate to your Steam install directory (usually "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam")
- Go into "steamui\css"
- Drop both BAT and PS1 files in the "css" folder (it should be in the same folder as "chunk~2dcc5aaf7.css")
- Double-click the BAT file
- Repeat the previous step whenever "What's New" pops back again into your library

You may want to create a shortcut to the BAT file for easier access in the future

## How do I download it?
- Through the [latest release](https://github.com/MateusAuri/SteamWhatsNewYeeter/releases/latest), the [ZIP](https://github.com/MateusAuri/SteamWhatsNewYeeter/releases/latest/download/SteamWhatsNewYeeter.zip) file contains both script files, you just gotta extract them to the "css" folder before using
- Or you could download both raw script files directly by right clicking and "Save link as...": [BAT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MateusAuri/SteamWhatsNewYeeter/zip/SteamWhatsNewYeeter.bat) | [PS1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MateusAuri/SteamWhatsNewYeeter/zip/SteamWhatsNewYeeter.ps1)

There's a chance you may need to allow a "suspicious downloads" popup from your browser and/or run it as admin, but that's just common safety measures for third-party scripts. 

The files are clean. Check the code yourself, run them through [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/) or whatever. Just please don't contact me asking about false positives. Inane requests will be duly ignored.

I'll try to keep this updated whenever Steam changes its files around, but no promises...
