# Steam Library's "What's New" Yeeter

What's this?
- This batch/powershell script hides that annoying "What's New" section from your Steam Library (on Windows)

Use instructions:
- Exit Steam
- Navigate to your Steam install directory (usually "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam")
- Go into "steamui\css"
- Drop both BAT and PS1 files in the "css" folder (it should be in the same folder as "chunk~2dcc5aaf7.css")
- Double-click the BAT file
- Repeat the previous step whenever "What's New" pops back again into your library

There's a chance you may need to allow a "suspicious downloads" popup from your browser and/or run it as admin, but that's just common safety measures for third-party scripts. 

The files are clean. Check the code yourself, run them through [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/) or whatever. Just please don't contact me asking about false positives. Inane requests will be duly ignored.
