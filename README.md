# Steam Library's "What's New" Yeeter

What's this?
- This batch/powershell script hides that annoying "What's New" section from your Steam Library (on Windows)

Use instructions:
- Exit Steam
- Navigate to your Steam install directory (usually "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam")
- Go into "steamui\css"
- Drop both BAT and PS1 files in the "css" folder (it should be in the same folder as "chunk~2dcc5aaf7.css")
- Double-click the BAT file
- Repeat the previous step whenever "What's New" pops back again into your library

There's a chance you may need to allow a "suspicious downloads" popup from your browser and/or run it as admin, but that's just common safety measures for third-party scripts. 

The files are clean. Check the code yourself, run them through [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/) or whatever. Just please don't contact me asking about false positives. Inane requests will be duly ignored.

I'll try to keep this updated whenever Steam changes its files around, but no promises...

If I somehow helped you and you wanna thank me, consider sending a dollar or so my way, because I'm broke af right now.
